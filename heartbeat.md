## Heartbeat April 2021 :

During the last 3 months : 
- I have kept working on the [JupyterLab RTC](https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc) project.  
_Tags : Python, Rust, JS, CRDT_

- I welcomed a former student of mine as a trainee. During his internship, he'll work on data of Strasbourg's public transport network (an evolution of [this previous project](http://ioapps.io/lab/cts)).  
This project collects around 7 GB of data per day (430 MB once zipped) that must be automatically analyzed, sorted and reworked to produce visualizations and compute statistics.

- Due to a [fire in an OVH DataCenter](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-ovh-fire-idUSKBN2B20NU) I had multiple servers to restore from scratch. Luckily (and because I follow the 3-2-1 backup law), no important data lost. Ironically, the datacenter is in my city and I could even _smell_ the smoke from my balcony ðŸ™ƒ

## Heartbeat January 2021 :

During the last 3 months : 

- I have started working on the [JupyterLab RTC](https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc) project.

- I did my first [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/) with my friends and colleagues during December. Very cool experience, I learned a lot !

- A 3.5 magnitude earthquake hit my town on December 4th 2020 , which is a very unusual event around here. This gave me the idea to make [a dashboard to visualise earthquakes in my region over the last decades](http://seismes.ioapps.io) ( [check the repo](https://github.com/pierrotsmnrd/earthquakes_strasbourg) )

- I've set up [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) on a Raspberry Pi to  monitor my flat's temperature, humidity and electricity consumption with various sensors and arduinos

- My semester of teaching at Strasbourg's University ended. Once again very happy to have shared my knowledge with so many brillant students. Teaching despite the second lockdown was a challenge though.
